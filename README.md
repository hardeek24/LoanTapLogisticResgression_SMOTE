INTRODUCTION:
When applying for a bank loan, there is a lengthy process involving the submission of various documents 
and details such as a good credit score, a no dues certificate, and sometimes even a no crime certificate. 
However, not everyone is eligible for these loans and able to meet all the documentation requirements 
and profile evaluations.
Loan Tap, as a company, aims to provide loans to individuals and small-sized firms (MSMEs) who may 
not be able to fulfill all the necessary requirements. They specifically target high-risk profiles as their 
potential customers, but within this category, there are three sub-profiles that loan applicants can fall into.
The first category is the "White Collar" customers, who are considered high risk but are expected to 
repay their loans. The second category is the "Grey Collar" customers, who have a mixed likelihood of 
repaying the loan. Lastly, the "Black Collar" customers are those who are unlikely to be able to repay the 
loan.
Loan Tap focuses on the White Collar and Grey Collar customers only. However, they cannot approve 
loans for all Grey Collar customers. This is where data scientists come in. They are needed to properly 
profile the Grey Collar customers so that Loan Tap can have a balanced mix of high-risk and low-risk 
customers, allowing them to potentially make a profit even if a few customers default on their loans. 
“Derogatory” is seen as negative to lenders, and can include late payments, collection accounts, 
bankruptcy, charge-offs and other negative marks on your credit report. 
The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio measures the amount of income a person or organization generates in 
order to service a debt. A DTI of 43% is typically the highest ratio a borrower can have and still get 
qualified for a mortgage, but lenders generally seek ratios of no more than 36%.
To calculate your DTI, you add up all your monthly debt payments and divide them by your gross monthly 
income. Your gross monthly income is generally the amount of money you have earned before your 
taxes and other deductions are taken out.
What is a revolving balance? BALANCE? With revolving credit, a consumer has a line of credit they can 
keep using and repaying over and over. The balance that carries over from one month to the next is the 
revolving balance on that loan.
Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding initiated when a person or business is unable to repay outstanding 
debts or obligations. It offers a fresh start for people who can no longer afford to pay their bills.
The variable initial_list_status is available in the public data and identifies whether a loan was initially 
listed in the whole (W) or fractional (F) market. Loans listed “whole” become available for fractional 
funding (and vice versa) if there are no buyers within a certain time frame.
